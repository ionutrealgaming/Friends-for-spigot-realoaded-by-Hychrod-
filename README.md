2. Setup
2.1 Single-Server:
To use friends on your server, you simply just need to put in your plugins folder and restart your server. You do not have to change anything else.

MySQL: If you want to use MySQL, you additionally need to edit the MySQL.yml which was generated inside plugins/FriendsRELOADED. Fill in your login-informations and restart your server a second time.

Friends should be setup correctly and is ready to use

2.2 BungeeCord-Networks:
To install friends on your Network you have to put FriendsRELOADED on every server you want the players to use the Inventory. ( For example: lobbys ). You do not need to put Friends on servers you do not want players to use the Friends-Inventory. After you are done, restart your servers.

Navigate into /plugins/FriendsRELOADED of every server and open up the config.yml's You are searching for an option called 'BungeeMode'. Make sure to enable this option.

Navigate back into the FriendsRELAODED folder of every server and open up your MySQL.yml's Fill in your login-informations and restart your servers a second time.

The next step is to download and install Friends-BungeeAddon on your BungeeCord-Server Do NOT put the BungeeAddon on your normal Servers, just put it on your Proxy and you are good to go. Download: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/friends2-0-mc1-8-1-10-bungeecord-addon.28909/

You have to setup MySQL on your Friends-BungeeAddon aswell. Navigate into '/plugins/Friends BungeeAddon' and open up the MySQL.yml Fill in your login-informations and restart your Proxy.

Everything should be setup correctly now and Friends is ready to use.

To verify everything is working as intended type ingame /friends version. You should be prompted with two separate messages telling you the version of FriendsRELOADED aswell as the Version of the Friends-BungeeAddon
